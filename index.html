          <p>The Ride Guide is a short, concise way of describing ride characteristics. There are 3 primary categories (distance/hilliness/SSSS) to help people better understand what to expect from a given ride.</p>
          <p>There are also 3 supplemental categories (food/water/# stops) that we encourage ride leaders to include as well.</p>
          <p>More detail on each category can be found throughout this document.</p>

            <p>We want to give people an idea of what the route will be like.
              This is not an exact science. Some rides have a lot of elevation gain with rolling hills. Some rides have moderate amounts of elevation gain but really steep climbs. Weâ€™re trying to provide general guidance on what it is going to feel like.</p>
