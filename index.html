        <section class="close">
          <p>The Ride Guide is a short, concise way of describing ride characteristics. There are 3 primary categories (distance/hilliness/SSSS) to help people better understand what to expect from a given ride.</p>
          <p>There are also 3 supplemental categories (food/water/# stops) that we encourage ride leaders to include as well.</p>
          <p>More detail on each category can be found throughout this document.</p>

        <section class="close">
          <p>Distance is mostly self-explanatory: how long is the ride? But more importantly, how do we anticipate that the length will impact the overall difficulty of the ride? For the sake of offering some concrete numbers we are going to say that a 1 on the scale is 10 miles or less and a 5 is a century ride (100 miles or more).</p>
          <p>Of course, like all things cycling, much of this is subjective and a person&rsquo;s past performance will likely dictate how they view the length of a ride. We would encourage ride leaders to err on the side of caution and give a higher rating if there is any doubt as to where on the scale a ride falls.</p>

          <p>Let&rsquo;s be real, most people tend to suffer on the climbs. There is a reason why it&rsquo;s KOM: &ldquo;King Of the Mountain&rdquo; and not &ldquo;King Of the Flats&rdquo; (though there are certainly flat KOMs on Strava). We want to give people an idea of what the route will &ldquo;feel&rdquo; like when it comes to elevation gain.</p>
          <p>But it is important to stress that this is not an exact science. Some rides have a lot of elevation gain with rolling hills. Some rides have moderate amounts of elevation gain but really steep climbs. We&rsquo;re trying to provide general guidance.</p>
          <p>In general we would ask ride leaders to weigh steeper climbs more heavily than climbs that don&rsquo;t pitch up as much. The following table is a good starting point though when considering the average rider.</p>

          <p>This is the information people are generally looking for when they ask questions like: &ldquo;what is the average speed of the ride?&rdquo; Most people who ask questions about &ldquo;pace&rdquo; and &ldquo;average speed&rdquo; really want to know one of two things:&nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Am I going to be left in the dust?</li>
            <li>Is this ride going to be painfully slow?&nbsp;</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Our attempt to answer this question involves creating several categories. These categories include general guidance for riders of different abilities. The ride leader may give additional guidance on their particular ride if needed. Assume that what the ride leader says takes precedence over what the SS/SS category says.</p>
