          <p>The Ride Guide is a short, concise way of describing ride characteristics. There are 3 primary categories (distance/hilliness/SSSS) to help people better understand what to expect from a given ride.</p>
          <p>There are also 3 supplemental categories (food/water/# stops) that we encourage ride leaders to include as well.</p>
          <p>More detail on each category can be found throughout this document.</p>

          <p>Here is an example of a Ride Guide that you might see on Facebook. The route and stats are pictured below. Details about each section can be found further on in this document.</p>

        <section class="close">
          <p>Distance is mostly self-explanatory: how long is the ride? But more importantly, how do we anticipate that the length will impact the overall difficulty of the ride? For the sake of offering some concrete numbers we are going to say that a 1 on the scale is 10 miles or less and a 5 is a century ride (100 miles or more).</p>
          <p>Of course, like all things cycling, much of this is subjective and a person&rsquo;s past performance will likely dictate how they view the length of a ride. We would encourage ride leaders to err on the side of caution and give a higher rating if there is any doubt as to where on the scale a ride falls.</p>
